============
These pieces of code were ported from dotnet/corefx:

syntax/charclass.go (from RegexCharClass.cs): ported to use the built-in Go unicode classes.  Canonicalize is 
    a direct port, but most of the other code required large changes because the C# implementation 
    used a string to represent the CharSet data structure and I cleaned that up in my implementation.

syntax/code.go (from RegexCode.cs): ported literally with various cleanups and layout to make it more Go-ish.

syntax/escape.go (from RegexParser.cs): ported Escape method and added some optimizations.  Unescape is inspired by 
    the C# implementation but couldn't be directly ported because of the lack of do-while syntax in Go.

syntax/parser.go (from RegexpParser.cs and RegexOptions.cs): ported parser struct and associated methods as 
    literally as possible. Several language differences required changes.  E.g. lack pre/post-fix increments as 
    expressions, lack of do-while loops, lack of overloads, etc.

syntax/prefix.go (from RegexFCD.cs and RegexBoyerMoore.cs): ported as literally as possible and added support
    for unicode chars that are longer than the 16-bit char in C# for the 32-bit rune in Go.

syntax/replacerdata.go (from RegexReplacement.cs): conceptually ported and re-organized to handle differences 
    in charclass implementation, and fix odd code layout between RegexParser.cs, Regex.cs, and RegexReplacement.cs.

syntax/tree.go (from RegexTree.cs and RegexNode.cs): ported literally as possible.

syntax/writer.go (from RegexWriter.cs): ported literally with minor changes to make it more Go-ish.

match.go (from RegexMatch.cs): ported, simplified, and changed to handle Go's lack of inheritence.

regexp.go (from Regex.cs and RegexOptions.cs): conceptually serves the same "starting point", but is simplified 
    and changed to handle differences in C# strings and Go strings/runes.  

replace.go (from RegexReplacement.cs): ported closely and then cleaned up to combine the MatchEvaluator and 
    simple string replace implementations.

runner.go (from RegexRunner.cs): ported literally as possible.

regexp_test.go (from CaptureTests.cs and GroupNamesAndNumbers.cs): conceptually ported, but the code was 
    manually structured like Go tests.

replace_test.go (from RegexReplaceStringTest0.cs): conceptually ported

rtl_test.go (from RightToLeft.cs): conceptually ported

============
These pieces of code are copied from the Go framework:

- The overall directory structure of regexp2 was inspired by the Go runtime regexp package.
- The optimization in the escape method of syntax/escape.go is from the Go runtime QuoteMeta() func in regexp/regexp.go
- The method signatures in regexp.go are designed to match the Go framework regexp methods closely
- func regexp2.MustCompile and func quote are almost identifical to the regexp package versions
- BenchmarkMatch* and TestProgramTooLong* funcs in regexp_performance_test.go were copied from the framework 
    regexp/exec_test.go
