## AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)

This repo contains a set of Kubernetes
[controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?fundamental=true#term-controller)
that manage resources in AWS service APIs.

ACK allows containerized applications and Kubernetes users to create, update,
delete and retrieve the status of objects in AWS services such as S3 buckets,
DynamoDB, RDS databases, SNS, etc. using the Kubernetes API, for example using
Kubernetes manifests or `kubectl` plugins.

Documentation, including installation and usage instructions, are
available online.
