// SourceFieldConfig instructs the code generator how to handle a field in the
// Resource's SpecFields/StatusFields collection that takes its value from an
// abnormal source -- in other words, not the Create operation's Input or
// Output shape.
//
// This additional field can source its value from a shape in a different API
// Operation entirely.
//
// The data type (Go type) that a field is assigned during code generation
// depends on whether the field is part of the Create Operation's Input shape
// which go into the Resource's Spec fields collection, or the Create
// Operation's Output shape which, if not present in the Input shape, means the
// field goes into the Resource's Status fields collection).
//
// Each Resource typically also has a ReadOne Operation. The ACK service
// controller will call this ReadOne Operation to get the latest observed state
// of a particular resource in the backend AWS API service. The service
// controller sets the observed Resource's Spec and Status fields from the
// Output shape of the ReadOne Operation. The code generator is responsible for
// producing the Go code that performs these "setter" methods on the Resource.
// The way the code generator determines how to set the Spec or Status fields
// from the Output shape's member fields is by looking at the data type of the
// Spec or Status field with the same name as the Output shape's member field.
//
// Importantly, in producing this "setter" Go code the code generator **assumes
// that the data types (Go types) in the source (the Output shape's member
// field) and target (the Spec or Status field) are the same**.
//
// There are some APIs, however, where the Go type of the field in the Create
// Operation's Input shape is actually different from the same-named field in
// the ReadOne Operation's Output shape. A good example of this is the Lambda
// CreateFunction API call, which has a `Code` member of its Input shape that
// looks like this:
//
// "Code": {
//   "ImageUri": "string",
//   "S3Bucket": "string",
//   "S3Key": "string",
//   "S3ObjectVersion": "string",
//   "ZipFile": blob
// },
//
// The GetFunction API call's Output shape has a same-named field called
// `Code` in it, but this field looks like this:
//
// "Code": {
//   "ImageUri": "string",
//   "Location": "string",
//   "RepositoryType": "string",
//   "ResolvedImageUri": "string"
// },
//
// This presents a conundrum to the ACK code generator, which, as noted above,
// assumes the data types of same-named fields in the Create Operation's Input
// shape and ReadOne Operation's Output shape are the same.
//
// The SourceFieldConfig struct allows us to explain to the code generator
// how to handle situations like this.
//
// For the Lambda Function Resource's `Code` field, we can inform the code
// generator to create three new Status fields (readonly) from the `Location`,
// `RepositoryType` and `ResolvedImageUri` fields in the `Code` member of the
// ReadOne Operation's Output shape:
//
// resources:
//   Function:
//     fields:
//       CodeLocation:
//         is_read_only: true
//         from:
//           operation: GetFunction
//           path: Code.Location
//       CodeRepositoryType:
//         is_read_only: true
//         from:
//           operation: GetFunction
//           path: Code.RepositoryType
//       CodeRegisteredImageURI:
//         is_read_only: true
//         from:
//           operation: GetFunction
//           path: Code.RegisteredImageUri
