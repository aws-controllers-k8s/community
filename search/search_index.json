ACK comprises a set of Kubernetes custom controllers . Each controller manages custom resources representing API resources of a single AWS service API. For example, the ACK service controller for AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) manages custom resources that represent AWS S3 buckets. Instead of logging into the AWS console or using the aws CLI tool to interact with the AWS service API, Kubernetes users can install a controller for an AWS service and then create, update, read and delete AWS resources using the Kubernetes API.

Below, you will find a description of the Project Stages that a service controller repository goes through on its way to being released. A controller that has reached the RELEASED project stage will have a set of release artifacts, including binary Docker images for the controller and a Helm Chart that installs the controller into a target Kubernetes cluster. Read more below about our Releases and Versioning policy . Finally, we have a set of documented Maintenance Phases that clearly outline our support stance for service controllers that have been released. Project Stages \u00b6 The controller's \"project stage\" describes how far along the controller is towards being released: PROPOSED -> PLANNED -> IN PROGRESS -> RELEASED PROPOSED \u00b6 The PROPOSED stage indicates that there is expressed interest in supporting an AWS service in ACK. At this stage, there will be a Github Issue and/or a Github Project for tracking the creation of the ACK service controller for the service. The GitHub Issue WILL NOT be associated with a GitHub Milestone. PLANNED \u00b6 The PLANNED stage indicates that we plan to make a controller for this service available in ACK. At this stage, there WILL BE a GitHub Milestone that tracks progress towards the release of the controller. IN PROGRESS \u00b6 The IN PROGRESS stage indicates that the ACK service controller for the AWS service is actively being built in preparation for a release of that ACK service controller. In the IN PROGRESS stage we identify those AWS service API resources that will be supported by the controller and generate the code that manages the lifecycle of these resources. !!! note \"what do we mean by 'AWS service API resources'? An AWS service API resource is a top-level object that can be created by a particular AWS service API. For example, an SNS Topic or an S3 Bucket. Some service APIs have multiple top-level resources; SNS, for instance, has Topic, PlatformApplication and PlatformEndpoint top-level resources that may be created. RELEASED \u00b6 The RELEASED project stage indicates that the ACK service controller source repository has had a Semantic Versioning Git tag applied and that both a Docker image and Helm Chart have been built and published to the ECR Public repositories for ACK. Once a service controller reaches the RELEASED project stage, that does not mean that there can never be any changes or additions to the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) or public interfaces exposed by that service controller. The RELEASED project stage is simply an indication that there is at least one SemVer-tagged binary release of the controller. Consumers should look to the SemVer release tag as an indication of whether code included in that release introduces new breaking (major version increment) or non-breaking features (minor version increment) or simply bug fixes (patch version increment). Consumers should see release notes for a release tag for a full description of changes included in that release. Releases and Versioning \u00b6 Important ACK does not have a single release status or version. Different components within the ACK project have different release cadences, versions and statuses. Please read the information below before installing any ACK component. Service controllers in ACK use Semantic Versioning to indicate whether changes included in a particular binary release introduce features or bug fixes and whether or not features break backwards compatibility for public APIs and interfaces. There are two release artifacts produced when an ACK service controller is released: a binary Docker image with the controller and a Helm Chart that installs the controller into a target Kubernetes cluster. Both these artifacts will have tags that correspond to the Semantic Version Git tag applied against the source code repository for the controller. Service controllers may have a Stable Helm Chart that will install a version of the service controller binary that the maintainer team is confident will hold up to production use. Semantic Versioning \u00b6 ACK is a collection of custom Kubernetes controllers, one for each supported AWS API. Each ACK controller is composed of an ACK common runtime and Go code that links the Kubernetes API and the AWS API. Much of this Go code is generated by the ack-generate tool; some of the Go code is hand-crafted. All code components in ACK use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) as a signal to consumers whether public interfaces or APIs have breaking changes. When an ACK component is released , a Git tag containing a SemVer (X.Y.Z) is created on the component's source repository. If the commits to the source repository in between the last Git tag and the commit being tagged have introduced changes that break public-facing APIs or interfaces, the SemVer will have its major version (\"X\") incremented. If the commits introduce functionality that does not break interfaces or APIs, the minor version (\"Y\") will be incremented. If the commits simply fix bugs and do not introduce any features or interface changes, the patch version (\"Z\") will be incremented. Releases of any ACK component that have a zero major release number (e.g. v0.0.2 ) may have breaking changes to the public API or interfaces exposed by that component. This is by design, and per the Semantic Versioning specification : Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable. For ACK components that have a binary distributable -- i.e. a Docker image -- the creation of a new SemVer Git tag on the source code repository triggers the automatic building and publishing of a Docker image with an image tag including the SemVer version. For example, if a Git tag of v1.2.6 was created on the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-controller repository, a Docker image with a tag v1.2.6 would be published to the public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-controller ECR Public repository. Note Binaries for individual ACK service controllers components are published in separate Amazon ECR Public repositories. For ACK components that have a Helm Chart distributable -- i.e. an ACK service controller -- the creation of a new SemVer Git tag on the source code repository triggers automatic building and publishing of a Helm Chart with an artifact tag including the SemVer version. For example, a Git tag of v1.2.6 on the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-controller repository means a Helm chart with a tag v1.2.6 would be published to the public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-chart ECR Public repository. A Word About Dependencies \u00b6 Each service-specific ACK controller -- e.g. the ElastiCache ACK controller -- depends on a specific version of the ACK common runtime. This dependency is specified in the controller's go.mod file. The ACK code generator that produces Go code for service controllers depends on a specific version of the ACK common runtime. dependency between the code generator and common runtime The ACK code generator depends on the ACK common runtime in a unique way: the Go code that the ACK code generator produces adheres to a specific version of the ACK common runtime. Even though no Go code in the ACK code generator actually imports the ACK common runtime, this dependency exists because the Go code produced by the templates inside the code generator imports the ACK common runtime. In order to make this Go code dependency more strict, we have a test package inside the ACK code generator that imports the ACK common runtime. In this way, we're able to include a version-specific dependency line in the ACK code generator's go.mod file, thereby allowing Go's module infrastructure to pin the dependency between the code generator and the common runtime. Stable Helm Charts \u00b6 Tip We recommend using Helm to install an ACK service controller. Some ACK service controllers will have Helm Charts with a v$MAJOR_VERSION-stable tag, referred from here out as just a \" stable artifact tag\". There will only be one of these tags for the ACK service controller in a major version series . For example, the full stable artifact tag for the ElastiCache ACK service controller's \"v1\" major version series would be public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/elasticache-chart:v1-stable . This stable artifact tag points to a Helm chart that has configuration values that have been tested with a specific SemVer Docker image. Typically these tests are \"soak\" tests and allow the team maintaining that ACK controller's source code to have a high degree of confidence in the controller's long-running operation. Note Please note that not all ACK service controllers will have a Helm chart with a stable artifact tag. Furthermore, there will only ever be a single stable Helm Chart tag per major version series of a controller . This stable Helm Chart tag (an OCI Artifact tag) will point to different Helm Chart packages over time. From time to time, the maintainer team for a service controller may update the configuration values and associated SemVer Docker image tag for the controller binary to point to a newer image. For example, consider the ElastiCache ACK service controller maintainer team has executed a series of long-running tests of the public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/elasticache-controller image tagged with the v1.2.6 SemVer tag. The maintainer team is confident that the controller is stable for production use. In the stable Git branch of the ElastiCache service controller's source repository, the team would update the Helm Chart's Deployment, setting the Deployment.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image to public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/elasticache-controller:v1.2.6 . They then package the Helm Chart and publish it as an OCI Artifact to the public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/elasticache-chart registry, using an OCI artifact tag of v1-stable . A couple months later, the maintainer team has added a few minor, non-breaking features to their controller along with a number of bug fixes. The latest SemVer tag for the ElastiCache controller image is at v1.3.9 . The maintainer team has separately been executing long-running tests against the v1.3.2 controller image and are confident that this release is appropriate for production use. The maintainer team would update the Helm Chart in their stable Git branch to have its Deployment.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image set to public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/elasticache-controller:v1.3.2 . They would then package this Helm Chart and push overwrite the public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/elasticache-chart:v1-stable OCI Artifact tag to point to this newly-updated Helm Chart that refers to the v1.3.2 controller image. Maintenance Phases \u00b6 As noted above, individual ACK service controllers all use Semantic Versioning (\"X.Y.Z\") in order to signal breaking interface changes. However, each controller follows its own release cadence and each controller has a separate team of contributors that maintain the code, test the controller and determine whether the controller is stable in long-running operation. ACK service controllers having release tags within a major Semantic Version (\"X\") will be in one of four Maintenance Phases: PREVIEW GENERAL AVAILABILITY (GA) DEPRECATED NOT SUPPORTED Preview \u00b6 ACK controllers in the Preview Maintenance Phase are released for testing by users and are not recommended for production use. For Preview controllers, we ask users to submit bug reports using Github Issues and we will do our best to remediate problems in a timely manner. General Availability \u00b6 ACK controllers in the General Availability (GA) Maintenance Phase have been through long-running \"soak\" tests and are recommended for production use by the team maintaining that controller. All ACK controllers in the General Availability Maintenance Phase will have a Helm Chart with the stable artifact tag. Users who submit bug reports using Github Issues that reference a General Availability controller will have their bug reports prioritized by the contributor team maintaining that controller. Deprecated \u00b6 ACK controllers in the General Availability Maintenance Phase may move to a Deprecated Maintenance Phase after a Deprecation Warning notice has been sent out (and the controller's documentation has been updated with said deprecation notice). Controllers in Deprecated Maintenance Phase continue to receive the same level of support as controllers in the General Availability phase. Not Supported \u00b6 ACK controllers may eventually be moved into a Not Supported Maintenance Phase. A controller major version series may move from the Preview Maintenance Phase to the Not Supported Maintenance Phase at any time. This may happen if the team maintaining the controller determines it is not possible to get the controller with that major version series into a General Availability phase. A controller major version series may move from the Deprecated Maintenance Phase to the Not Supported Maintenance Phase only after a 1-year deprecation period has elapsed .","title":"Releases, Versioning and Maintenance Phases"},{"location":"releases/#releases-versioning-and-maintenance-phases","text":"Service controllers are built in separate source code repositories.

Answer For the time being, people using the service broker should continue to use it and we're coordinating with the maintainers to provide a unified solution. The service broker project is also an AWS activity that, with the general shift of focus in the community from service broker to operators, can be considered less actively developed. There are a certain things around application lifecycle management that the service broker currently covers and which are at this juncture not yet covered by the scope of ACK, however we expect in the mid to long run that these two projects converge. We had AWS-internal discussions with the team that maintains the service broker and we're on the same page concerning a unified solution. We appreciate input and advice concerning features that are currently covered by the service broker only, for example bind/unbind or cataloging and looking forward to learn from the community how they are using service broker so that we can take this into account. Cluster API \u00b6 Question Does the planned ACK service controller for EKS replace Kubernetes Cluster API ? Answer No, the ACK service controller for EKS does not replace Kubernetes Cluster API. Cluster API does a lot of really cool things and is designed to be a generic way to create Kubernetes clusters that run anywhere. It makes some different design decisions with that goal in mind. Some differences include: Cluster API is treated as your source of truth for all infrastructure. This means things like the cluster autoscaler need to be configured to use cluster api instead of AWS cloud provider. Generic Kubernetes clusters rely on running more services in the cluster and not services from AWS. Things like metrics and logging will likely need to run inside Kubernetes instead of using services like CloudWatch. IAM permission for Cluster-API Provider AWS (CAPA) need to be more broad than the ACK service controller for EKS because CAPA is responsible for provisioning everything needed for the cluster (VPC, gateway, etc). You don't need to run all of the ACK controllers if all you want is a way to provision an EKS cluster. You can pick and choose which ACK controllers you want to deploy. With the EKS ACK controller you will get all of the configuration flexibility of the EKS API including things like managed node groups and fargate. This is because the ACK service controller for EKS is built directly from the EKS API spec and not abstracted to be a general Kubernetes cluster. cdk8s \u00b6 Question How does ACK relate to cdk8s ? Answer cdk8s is an open-source software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages and rich object-oriented APIs. You can use cdk8s to create any resource inside a Kubernetes cluster. This includes Custom Resources (CRs). All of the ACK controllers watch for specific CRs and you can generate those resources using cdk8s or any Kubernetes tooling. The two projects complement each other. cdk8s can create the Kubernetes resources and ACK uses those resources to create the AWS infrastructure. Contributing \u00b6 Question Where and how can I help?

The Kubernetes Resource Model \u00b6 The Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) is a set of standards and naming conventions that govern how an Object may be created and updated. An Object includes some metadata about the object -- a GroupVersionKind (GVK), a Name , a Namespace , and zero or more Labels and Annotations . In addition to this metadata, each Object has a Spec field which is a struct that contains the desired state of the Object . Objects are typically denoted using YAML, like so: apiVersion : s3.services.k8s.aws/v1alpha1 kind : Bucket metadata : name : my-amazing-bucket annotations : pronounced-as : boo-kay spec : name : my-amazing-bucket Manifests The YAML files containing an object definition like above are typically called manifests . Above, the Object has a GVK of \"s3.services.k8s.aws/v1alpha1:Bucket\" with an internal-to-Kubernetes Name of \"my-amazing-bucket\" and a single Annotation key/value pair \"pronounced-as: boo-kay\". The Spec field is a structure containing desired state fields about this Bucket. You can see here that there is a Spec.Name field representing the Bucket name that will be passed to the S3 CreateBucket API as the name of the Bucket. Note that the Metadata.Name field value is the same as the Spec.Name field value here, but there's nothing mandatory about this. When a Kubernetes user creates an Object , typically by passing some YAML to the kubectl create or kubectl apply CLI command, the Kubernetes API server reads the manifest and determines whether the supplied contents are valid. In order to determine if a manifest is valid, the Kubernetes API server must look up the definition of the specified GroupVersionKind . For all of the resources that ACK is concerned about, what this means is that the Kubernetes API server will search for the CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) matching the GroupVersionKind . This CRD describes the fields that comprise Object s of that particular GroupVersionKind -- called CustomResources (CRs). In the next sections we discuss: how ACK determines what will become a CRD how ACK determines the fields that go into each CRD's Spec and Status Which things become ACK Resources? \u00b6 As mentioned in the code generation documentation , ACK reads AWS API model files when generating its API types and controller implementations. These model files are JSON files contain some important information about the structure of the AWS service API, including a set of Operation definitions (commonly called \"Actions\" in the official AWS API documentation) and a set of Shape definitions. Some AWS APIs have dozens (hundreds even!) of Operations exposed by the API. Consider EC2's API. It has over 400 separate Actions . Out of all those Operations, how are we to tell which ones refer to something that we can model as a Kubernetes CustomResource ? Well, we could look at the EC2 API's list of Operations and manually decide which ones seem \"resource-y\". Operations like \"AdvertiseByoipCidr\" and \"AcceptTransitGatewayVpcAttachment\" don't seem very \"resource-y\". Operations like \"CreateKeyPair\" and \"DeleteKeyPair\", however, do seem like they would match a resource called \"KeyPair\". And this is actually how ACK decides what is a CustomResource and what isn't. It uses a simple heuristic: look through the list of Operations in the API model file and filter out the ones that start with the string \"Create\". If what comes after the word \"Create\" describes a singular noun, then we create a CustomResource of that Kind . It really is that simple. How is an ACK Resource Defined? \u00b6 Let's take a look at the CRD for ACK's S3 Bucket (the s3.services.k8s.aws/Bucket GroupKind (GK)) (snipped slightly for brevity): --- apiVersion : apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 kind : CustomResourceDefinition metadata : name : buckets.s3.services.k8s.aws spec : group : s3.services.k8s.aws names : kind : Bucket scope : Namespaced versions : - name : v1alpha1 schema : openAPIV3Schema : description : Bucket is the Schema for the Buckets API properties : apiVersion : type : string kind : type : string metadata : type : object spec : description : BucketSpec defines the desired state of Bucket properties : acl : type : string createBucketConfiguration : properties : locationConstraint : type : string type : object grantFullControl : type : string grantRead : type : string grantReadACP : type : string grantWrite : type : string grantWriteACP : type : string name : type : string objectLockEnabledForBucket : type : boolean required : - name type : object status : description : BucketStatus defines the observed state of Bucket properties : ackResourceMetadata : properties : arn : type : string ownerAccountID : type : string required : - ownerAccountID type : object conditions : items : properties : lastTransitionTime : format : date-time type : string message : type : string reason : type : string status : type : string type : type : string required : - status - type type : object type : array location : type : string required : - ackResourceMetadata - conditions type : object type : object The above YAML representation of a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is actually generated from a set of Go type definitions. These Go type definitions live in each ACK service's services/$SERVICE/apis/$VERSION directory. This section of our documentation discusses how we create those Go type definitions. controller-gen crd The OpenAPIv3 Validating Schema shown above is created by the controller-gen crd CLI command and is a convenient human-readable representation of the CustomResourceDefinition . The Bucket CR's Spec field is defined above as containing a set of fields -- \"acl\", \"createBucketConfiguration\", \"name\", etc. Each field has a JSONSchema type that corresponds with the Go type from the associated field member. You will also notice that in addition to the definition of a Spec field, there is also the definition of a Status field for the Bucket CRs. Above, this Status contains fields that represent the \"observed\" state of the Bucket CRs. The above shows three fields in the Bucket's Status : ackResourceMetadata , conditions and location . You might be wondering how the ACK code generator determined which fields go into the Bucket's Spec and which fields go into the Bucket's Status ? Well, it's definitely not a manual process. Everything in ACK is code-generated and discovered by inspecting the AWS API model files. what are AWS API model files? The AWS API model files are JSON files that contain information about a particular AWS service API's Actions and Shapes. We consume the model files distributed in the aws-sdk-go project. (Look for the api-2.json files in the linked service-specific directories...) Let's take a look at a tiny bit of the AWS S3 API model file and you can start to see how we identify the things that go into the Spec and Status fields. { \"metadata\" :{ \"serviceId\" : \"S3\" , }, \"operations\" :{ \"CreateBucket\" :{ \"name\" : \"CreateBucket\" , \"http\" :{ \"method\" : \"PUT\" , \"requestUri\" : \"/{Bucket}\" }, \"input\" :{ \"shape\" : \"CreateBucketRequest\" }, \"output\" :{ \"shape\" : \"CreateBucketOutput\" }, }, }, \"shapes\" :{ \"BucketCannedACL\" :{ \"type\" : \"string\" , \"enum\" :[ \"private\" , \"public-read\" , \"public-read-write\" , \"authenticated-read\" ] }, \"BucketName\" :{ \"type\" : \"string\" }, \"CreateBucketConfiguration\" :{ \"type\" : \"structure\" , \"members\" :{ \"LocationConstraint\" :{ \"shape\" : \"BucketLocationConstraint\" } } }, \"CreateBucketOutput\" :{ \"type\" : \"structure\" , \"members\" :{ \"Location\" :{ \"shape\" : \"Location\" , } } }, \"CreateBucketRequest\" :{ \"type\" : \"structure\" , \"required\" :[ \"Bucket\" ], \"members\" :{ \"ACL\" :{ \"shape\" : \"BucketCannedACL\" , }, \"Bucket\" :{ \"shape\" : \"BucketName\" , }, \"CreateBucketConfiguration\" :{ \"shape\" : \"CreateBucketConfiguration\" , }, \"GrantFullControl\" :{ \"shape\" : \"GrantFullControl\" , }, \"GrantRead\" :{ \"shape\" : \"GrantRead\" , }, \"GrantReadACP\" :{ \"shape\" : \"GrantReadACP\" , }, \"GrantWrite\" :{ \"shape\" : \"GrantWrite\" , }, \"GrantWriteACP\" :{ \"shape\" : \"GrantWriteACP\" , }, \"ObjectLockEnabledForBucket\" :{ \"shape\" : \"ObjectLockEnabledForBucket\" , } }, }, } } As mentioned above, we determine what things in an API are CustomResourceDefinition s by looking for Operation s that begin with the string \"Create\" and where the remainder of the Operation name refers to a singular noun. For the S3 API, there happens to be only a single Operation that begins with the string \"Create\", and it happens to be \" CreateBucket \". And since \"Bucket\" refers to a singular noun, that is the CustomResourceDefinition that is identified by the ACK code generator. The ACK code generator writes a file apis/v1alpha1/bucket.go that contains a BucketSpec struct definition, a BucketStatus struct definition and a Bucket struct definition that ties the Spec and Status together into our CRD. In determining the structure of the s3.services.k8s.aws/Bucket CRD, the ACK code generator inspects the Shape s referred to by the \"input\" and \"output\" members of the \"CreateBucket\" Operation : \"CreateBucketRequest\" and \"CreateBucketOutput\" respectively. Determining the Spec fields \u00b6 For the BucketSpec fields, we grab members of the Input shape. The generated Go type definition for the BucketSpec ends up looking like this: // BucketSpec defines the desired state of Bucket type BucketSpec struct { ACL * string `json:\"acl,omitempty\"` CreateBucketConfiguration * CreateBucketConfiguration `json:\"createBucketConfiguration,omitempty\"` GrantFullControl * string `json:\"grantFullControl,omitempty\"` GrantRead * string `json:\"grantRead,omitempty\"` GrantReadACP * string `json:\"grantReadACP,omitempty\"` GrantWrite * string `json:\"grantWrite,omitempty\"` GrantWriteACP * string `json:\"grantWriteACP,omitempty\"` // +kubebuilder:validation:Required Name * string `json:\"name\"` ObjectLockEnabledForBucket * bool `json:\"objectLockEnabledForBucket,omitempty\"` } Let's take a closer look at the BucketSpec fields. The ACL , GrantFullControl , GrantRead , GrantReadACP , GrantWrite and GrantWriteACP fields are simple *string types. However, if we look at the CreateBucketRequest Shape definition in the API model file, we see that these fields actually are differently-named Shapes, not *string . Why is this? Well, the ACK code generator \"flattens\" some Shapes when it notices that a named Shape is just an alias for a simple scalar type (like *string ). !!! \"why *string ?\" The astute reader may be wondering why the Go type for string fields is *string and not string . The reason for this lies in aws-sdk-go . All types for all Shape members are pointer types, even when the underlying data type is a simple scalar type like bool or int . Yes, even when the field is required... Note that even though the ACL field has a Shape of BucketCannedACL , that Shape is actually just a string with a set of enumerated values. Enumerated values are collected and written out by the ACK code generator into an apis/v1alpha1/enums.go file, with content like this: type BucketCannedACL string const ( BucketCannedACL_private BucketCannedACL = \"private\" BucketCannedACL_public_read BucketCannedACL = \"public-read\" BucketCannedACL_public_read_write BucketCannedACL = \"public-read-write\" BucketCannedACL_authenticated_read BucketCannedACL = \"authenticated-read\" ) The CreateBucketConfiguration field is of type *CreateBucketConfiguration . All this means is that the field refers to a nested struct. All struct type definitions for CRD Spec or Status field members are placed by the ACK code generator into a apis/v1alpha1/types.go file. Here is a snippet of that file that contains the type definition for the CreateBucketConfiguration struct: type CreateBucketConfiguration struct { LocationConstraint * string `json:\"locationConstraint,omitempty\"` } Now, the Name field in the BucketSpec struct seems out of place, no? There is no \"Name\" member of the CreateBucketRequest Shape, so why is there a Name field in BucketSpec ? Well, this is an example of ACK's code generator using some special instructions contained in something called the generator.yaml (or \"generator config\") for the S3 service controller. Each service in the services/ directory can have a generator.yaml file that contains overrides and special instructions for how to interpret and transform parts of the service's API. Here is part of the S3 service's generator.yaml file: resources : Bucket : renames : operations : CreateBucket : input_fields : Bucket : Name As you can see, the generator config for the ACK S3 service controller is renaming the CreateBucket Operation's Input Shape Bucket field to Name . We do this for some APIs to add a little consistency and a more Kubernetes-native experience for the CRDs. In Kubernetes, there is a Metadata.Name (internal Kubernetes name) and there is typically a Spec.Name field which refers to the external Name of the resource. So, in order to align the s3.services.k8s.aws/Bucket 's definition to be more Kubernetes-like, we rename the Bucket field to Name . We do this renaming for other things that produce a bit of a \" stutter \", as well as where the name of a field does not conform to Go exported name constraints or naming best practices . Determining the Status fields \u00b6 Remember that fields in a CR's Status struct are not mutable by normal Kubernetes users. Instead, these fields represent the latest observed state of a resource (instead of the desired state of that resource which is represented by fields in the CR's Spec struct). The ACK code generator takes the members of the Create Operation 's Output shape and puts those fields into the CR's Status struct. We assume that fields in the Output that have the same name as fields in the Input shape for the Create Operation refer to the resource field that was set in the Spec field and therefore are only interested in fields in the Output that are not in the Input . Looking at the BucketSpec struct definition that was generated after processing the S3 API model file, we find this : // BucketStatus defines the observed state of Bucket type BucketStatus struct { // All CRs managed by ACK have a common `Status.ACKResourceMetadata` member // that is used to contain resource sync state, account ownership, // constructed ARN for the resource ACKResourceMetadata * ackv1alpha1 . ResourceMetadata `json:\"ackResourceMetadata\"` // All CRS managed by ACK have a common `Status.Conditions` member that // contains a collection of `ackv1alpha1.Condition` objects that describe // the various terminal states of the CR and its backend AWS service API // resource Conditions [] * ackv1alpha1 . Condition `json:\"conditions\"` Location * string `json:\"location,omitempty\"` } Let's discuss each of the fields shown above. First, the ACKResourceMetadata field is included in every ACK CRD's Status field . It is a pointer to a ackv1alpha1.ResourceMetadata struct. This struct contains some standard and important pieces of information about the resource, including the AWS Resource Name (ARN) and the Owner AWS Account ID. The ARN is a globally-unique identifier for the resource in AWS. The Owner AWS Account ID is the 12-digit AWS account ID that is billed for the resource. cross-account resource management The Owner AWS Account ID for a resource may be different from the AWS Account ID of the IAM Role that the ACK service controller is executing under. The Conditions field is also included in every ACK CRD's Status field. It is a slice of pointers to ackv1alpha1.Condition structs. The Condition struct is responsible for conveying information about the latest observed sync state of a resource, including any terminal condition states that cause the resource to be \"unsyncable\". Next is the Location field. This field gets its definition from the S3 CreateBucketOutput.Location field: \"CreateBucketOutput\" :{ \"type\" : \"structure\" , \"members\" :{ \"Location\" :{ \"shape\" : \"Location\" , } } },","title":"API Inference"},{"location":"dev-docs/api-inference/#api-inference","text":"This document discusses how ACK introspects an AWS API model file and determines which CustomResourceDefinition s (CRDs) to construct and what the structure of those CRDs look like.","title":"API Inference"},{"location":"dev-docs/api-inference/#the-kubernetes-resource-model","text":"The Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) is a set of standards and naming conventions that govern how an Object may be created and updated. An Object includes some metadata about the object -- a GroupVersionKind (GVK), a Name , a Namespace , and zero or more Labels and Annotations . In addition to this metadata, each Object has a Spec field which is a struct that contains the desired state of the Object . Objects are typically denoted using YAML, like so: apiVersion : s3.services.k8s.aws/v1alpha1 kind : Bucket metadata : name : my-amazing-bucket annotations : pronounced-as : boo-kay spec : name : my-amazing-bucket Manifests The YAML files containing an object definition like above are typically called manifests . Above, the Object has a GVK of \"s3.services.k8s.aws/v1alpha1:Bucket\" with an internal-to-Kubernetes Name of \"my-amazing-bucket\" and a single Annotation key/value pair \"pronounced-as: boo-kay\". The Spec field is a structure containing desired state fields about this Bucket. You can see here that there is a Spec.Name field representing the Bucket name that will be passed to the S3 CreateBucket API as the name of the Bucket. Note that the Metadata.Name field value is the same as the Spec.Name field value here, but there's nothing mandatory about this. When a Kubernetes user creates an Object , typically by passing some YAML to the kubectl create or kubectl apply CLI command, the Kubernetes API server reads the manifest and determines whether the supplied contents are valid. In order to determine if a manifest is valid, the Kubernetes API server must look up the definition of the specified GroupVersionKind . For all of the resources that ACK is concerned about, what this means is that the Kubernetes API server will search for the CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) matching the GroupVersionKind . This CRD describes the fields that comprise Object s of that particular GroupVersionKind -- called CustomResources (CRs).

These model files are JSON files contain some important information about the structure of the AWS service API, including a set of Operation definitions (commonly called \"Actions\" in the official AWS API documentation) and a set of Shape definitions. Some AWS APIs have dozens (hundreds even!) of Operations exposed by the API. Consider EC2's API. It has over 400 separate Actions . Out of all those Operations, how are we to tell which ones refer to something that we can model as a Kubernetes CustomResource ? Well, we could look at the EC2 API's list of Operations and manually decide which ones seem \"resource-y\". Operations like \"AdvertiseByoipCidr\" and \"AcceptTransitGatewayVpcAttachment\" don't seem very \"resource-y\". Operations like \"CreateKeyPair\" and \"DeleteKeyPair\", however, do seem like they would match a resource called \"KeyPair\".

Handle controller-gen: command not found If you run into the controller-gen: command not found message when executing make build-controller then you want to check if the controller-gen binary is available in $GOPATH/bin , also ensure that $GOPATH/bin is part of your $PATH , see also #234 . You can also install the required version of controller-gen using the scripts/install-controller-gen.sh helper script.

Options considered \u00b6 To generate custom resource (definitions) and controller stub code, we investigated a number of options: home-grown custom code generator kudo kubebuilder a hybrid custom code generator + sigs.kubernetes.io/controller-tools (CR) The original AWS Service Operator used a custom-built generator that processed YAML manifests describing the AWS service and used templates to generate CRDs , the controller code itself and the Go types that represent the CRDs in memory. It's worth noting that the CRDs and the controller code that was generated by the original ASO was very tightly coupled to CloudFormation. In fact, the CRDs for individual AWS services like S3 or RDS were thin wrappers around CloudFormation stacks that described the object being operated upon. kudo is a platform for building Kubernetes Operators. It stores state in its own kudo.dev CRDs and allows users to define \"plans\" for a deployed application to deploy itself. We determined that kudo was not a particularly good fit for ASO for a couple reasons. First, we needed a way to generate CRDs in several API groups (s3.aws.com and iam.aws.com for example) and the ACK controller code isn't deploying an \"application\" that needs to have a controlled deployment plan. Instead, ACK is a collection of controllers that facilitates creation and management of various AWS service objects using Kubernetes CRD instances. kubebuilder is the recommended upstream tool for generating CRDs and controller stub code. It is a Go binary that creates the scaffolding for CRDs and controller Go code. It has support for multiple API groups (e.g. s3.amazonaws.com and dynamodb.amazonaws.com ) in a single code repository, so allows for sensible separation of code. Our final option was to build a hybrid custom code generator that used controller-runtime under the hood but allowed us to generate controller stub code for multiple API groups and place generated code in directories that represented Go best practices. This option gives us the flexibility to generate the files and content for multiple API groups but still stay within the recommended guardrails of the upstream Kubernetes community. Our approach \u00b6 We ended up with a hybrid custom+controller-runtime, using multiple phases of code generation: The first code generation phase consumes model information from a canonical source of truth about an AWS service and the objects and interfaces that service exposes and generates files containing code that exposes Go types for those objects. These \"type files\" should be annotated with the marker and comments that will allow the core code generators and controller-gen to do its work. We will use the model files from the aws-sdk-go source repository as our source of truth and use the aws-sdk-go/private/model/api Go package to navigate that model. Note This step is the ack-generate apis command. After generating Kubernetes API type definitions for the top-level resources exposed by the AWS API, we then need to generate the \"DeepCopy\" interface implementations that enable those top-level resources and type definitions to be used by the Kubernetes runtime package (it defines an interface called runtime.Object that requires certain methods that copy the object and its component parts). Note This step runs the controller-gen object command Next, we generate the custom resource definition (CRD) configuration files, one for each top-level resource identified in earlier steps. Note This step runs the controller-gen crd command Next, we generate the actual implementation of the ACK controller for the target service. This step uses a set of templates and code in the pkg/model Go package to construct the service-specific resource management and linkage with the aws-sdk-go client for the service. Along with these controller implementation Go files, this step also outputs a set of Kubernetes configuration files for the Deployment and the ClusterRoleBinding of the Role created in the next step.

No matter if you're contributing code or docs, follow the steps below to set up your development environment. Issue before PR Of course we're happy about code drops via PRs, however, in order to give us time to plan ahead and also to avoid disappointment, consider creating an issue first and submit a PR later. This also helps us to coordinate between different contributors and should in general help keeping everyone happy. Prerequisites \u00b6 Please ensure that you have properly installed Go . Go version We recommend to use a Go version of 1.15 or above for development. Fork upstream repositories \u00b6 The first step in setting up your ACK development environment is to fork the upstream ACK source code repositories to your personal Github account. There are three common upstream repositories you should fork first: github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/runtime is the core ACK runtime and types github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/code-generator is the ACK code generator github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/test-infra contains the testing scripts prefix ACK forked repos with 'ack-' When I fork repositories to my personal Github account, I tend to prefix the repositories with a common string for grouping purposes. For ACK source repositories that I forked from the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s Github Organization, I prefix those repositories with \"ack-\". For example, when I forked the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/code-generator repository to my github.com/jaypipes personal space on Github, I immediately renamed the forked repo to github.com/jaypipes/ack-code-generator . This makes it easier to quickly filter repositories that are forked from the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s Github Organization. After forking the above common repositories, fork the upstream service controller repositories that you wish to work on or test out. The upstream service controller repositories are in the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s Github Organization and follow a naming schema of $SERVICE_ALIAS-controller . So, if you wanted to work on the S3 service controller, you would fork the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-controller source repository to your personal Github space. Ensure source code organization directories exist \u00b6 Make sure in your $GOPATH/src that you have directories for the aws-controllers-k8s organization: mkdir -p $GOPATH /src/github.com/aws-controllers-k8s git clone forked repositories and add upstream remote \u00b6 For each of your forked repositories, you will git clone the repository into the appropriate folder in your $GOPATH . Once git clone 'd, you will want to set up a Git remote called \"upstream\" (remember that \"origin\" will be pointing at your forked repository location in your personal Github space). You can use this script to do this for you: GITHUB_ID = \"your GH username\" # Set this to \"\" if you did NOT take my advice above in the tip about prefixing # your personal forked ACK repository names with \"ack-\" ACK_REPO_PREFIX = \"ack-\" # Clone all the common ACK repositories...

For example, when I forked the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/code-generator repository to my github.com/jaypipes personal space on Github, I immediately renamed the forked repo to github.com/jaypipes/ack-code-generator . This makes it easier to quickly filter repositories that are forked from the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s Github Organization. After forking the above common repositories, fork the upstream service controller repositories that you wish to work on or test out. The upstream service controller repositories are in the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s Github Organization and follow a naming schema of $SERVICE_ALIAS-controller . So, if you wanted to work on the S3 service controller, you would fork the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-controller source repository to your personal Github space.","title":"Fork upstream repositories"},{"location":"dev-docs/setup/#ensure-source-code-organization-directories-exist","text":"Make sure in your $GOPATH/src that you have directories for the aws-controllers-k8s organization: mkdir -p $GOPATH /src/github.com/aws-controllers-k8s","title":"Ensure source code organization directories exist"},{"location":"dev-docs/setup/#git-clone-forked-repositories-and-add-upstream-remote","text":"For each of your forked repositories, you will git clone the repository into the appropriate folder in your $GOPATH .

You may use these steps to run e2e tests for other ACK service controllers. If you run into any problems when testing a service controller, please raise an issue with the details so we can reproduce your issue. Prerequisites \u00b6 For local development and testing we use \"Kubernetes in Docker\" ( kind ), which in turn requires Docker. Footprint When you run the scripts/kind-build-test.sh script the first time, the step that builds the container image for the target ACK service controller can take up to 40 or more minutes. This is because the container image contains a lot of dependencies. Once you successfully build the target image this base image layer is cached locally, and the build takes a much shorter amount of time. We are aware of this (and the storage footprint, ca. 3 GB) and aim to reduce both in the fullness of time. In summary, in order to test ACK you will need to have the following tools installed and configured: Golang 1.14+ make Docker kind jq To build and test an ACK controller with kind , execute the commands as described in the following from the root directory of the github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/community repository. You should have forked this repository and git clone 'd it locally when setting up your development environment . Recommended RAM Given that our test setup creates the container images and then launches a test cluster, we recommend that you have at least 4GB of RAM available for the tests. With the prerequisites out of the way, let's move on to running e2e tests for a service controller. Run tests \u00b6 Time to run the end-to-end test. IAM setup \u00b6 In order for the ACK service controller to manage the S3 bucket, it needs an identity. In other words, it needs an IAM role that represents the ACK service controller towards the S3 service. First, define the name of the IAM role that will have the permission to manage S3 buckets on your behalf: export ACK_TEST_IAM_ROLE = Admin - k8s Now we need to verify the IAM principal (likely an IAM user) that is going to assume the IAM role ACK_TEST_IAM_ROLE . So to get its ARN, execute: export ACK_TEST_PRINCIPAL_ARN =$ ( aws sts get - caller - identity -- query 'Arn' -- output text ) You can verify if that worked using echo $ACK_TEST_PRINCIPAL_ARN and that should print something along the lines of arn:aws:iam::1234567890121:user/ausername . Next up, create the IAM role, adding the necessary trust relationship to the role, using the following commands: cat > trust-policy.json << EOF { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": \"$ACK_TEST_PRINCIPAL_ARN\" }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } } EOF Using above trust policy, we can now create the IAM role: aws iam create-role \\ --role-name $ACK_TEST_IAM_ROLE \\ --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json Now we're in the position to give the IAM role ACK_TEST_IAM_ROLE the permission to handle S3 buckets for us, using: aws iam attach-role-policy \\ --role-name $ACK_TEST_IAM_ROLE \\ --policy-arn \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess\" Access delegation in IAM If you're not that familiar with IAM access delegation, we recommend you to peruse the IAM documentation Next, in order for our test to generate temporary credentials we need to tell it to use the IAM role we created in the previous step. To generate the IAM role ARN, do: AWS_ACCOUNT_ID =$ ( aws sts get - caller - identity -- query 'Account' -- output text ) && \\ export ACK_ROLE_ARN = arn : aws : iam :: $ { AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }: role /$ { ACK_TEST_IAM_ROLE } Info The tests uses the generate_temp_creds function from the scripts/lib/aws.sh script, executing effectively aws sts assume-role --role-session-arn $ACK_ROLE_ARN --role-session-name $TEMP_ROLE which fetches temporarily AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID , AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY , and an AWS_SESSION_TOKEN used in turn to authentication the ACK controller. The duration of the session token is 900 seconds (15 minutes). Phew that was a lot to set up, but good news: you're almost there. Run end-to-end test \u00b6 Before you proceed, make sure that you've done the IAM setup in the previous step. IAM troubles?! If you try the following command and you see an error message containing something along the line of ACK_ROLE_ARN is not defined. then you know that somewhere in the IAM setup you either left out a step or one of the commands failed. Now we're finally in the position to execute the end-to-end test: make kind-test SERVICE=$SERVICE This provisions a Kubernetes cluster using kind , builds a container image with the ACK service controller, and loads the container image into the kind cluster. It then installs the ACK service controller and related Kubernetes manifests into the kind cluster using kustomize build | kubectl apply -f - . Then, the above script runs a series of test scripts that call kubectl and the aws CLI tools to verify that custom resources of the type managed by the respective ACK service controller is created, updated and deleted appropriately (still TODO). Finally, it will run tests that create resources for the respective service and verify if the resource has successfully created. In our example case it should create an S3 bucket and then destroy it again, yielding something like the following (edited down to the relevant parts): ... ./ scripts / kind - build - test . sh - s s3 Using Kubernetes kindest / node : v1 . 16.9 @ sha256 : 7175872357 bc85847ec4b1aba46ed1d12fa054c83ac7a8a11f5c268957fd5765 Creating k8s cluster using \"kind\" ...

For more information, see Data Model (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DataModel.html) in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. Each KeySchemaElement in the array is composed of: * AttributeName - The name of this key attribute. * KeyType - The role that the key attribute will assume: HASH - partition key RANGE - sort key The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attribute. The term \"hash attribute\" derives from the DynamoDB usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values. The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute. The term \"range attribute\" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value. For a simple primary key (partition key), you must provide exactly one element with a KeyType of HASH. For a composite primary key (partition key and sort key), you must provide exactly two elements, in this order: The first element must have a KeyType of HASH, and the second element must have a KeyType of RANGE. For more information, see Working with Tables (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html#WorkingWithTables.primary.key) in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. keySchema.[] Required object Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index. A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one KeySchemaElement for the partition key, and another KeySchemaElement for the sort key. A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map. keySchema.[].keyType Optional string localSecondaryIndexes Optional array One or more local secondary indexes (the maximum is 5) to be created on the table. Each index is scoped to a given partition key value. There is a 10 GB size limit per partition key value; otherwise, the size of a local secondary index is unconstrained. Each local secondary index in the array includes the following: * IndexName - The name of the local secondary index. Must be unique only for this table. * KeySchema - Specifies the key schema for the local secondary index. The key schema must begin with the same partition key as the table. * Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. Each attribute specification is composed of: ProjectionType - One of the following: KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index. INCLUDE - Only the specified table attributes are projected into the index. The list of projected attributes is in NonKeyAttributes. ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into the index. NonKeyAttributes - A list of one or more non-key attribute names that are projected into the secondary index. The total count of attributes provided in NonKeyAttributes, summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. localSecondaryIndexes.[] Required object Represents the properties of a local secondary index. localSecondaryIndexes.[].keySchema Optional array localSecondaryIndexes.[].keySchema.[] Required object Represents a single element of a key schema.

For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see Launch template support (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide. instanceTypes Optional array Specify the instance types for a node group. If you specify a GPU instance type, be sure to specify AL2_x86_64_GPU with the amiType parameter. If you specify launchTemplate, then you can specify zero or one instance type in your launch template or you can specify 0-20 instance types for instanceTypes. If however, you specify an instance type in your launch template and specify any instanceTypes, the node group deployment will fail. If you don't specify an instance type in a launch template or for instanceTypes, then t3.medium is used, by default. If you specify Spot for capacityType, then we recommend specifying multiple values for instanceTypes. For more information, see Managed node group capacity types (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html#managed-node-group-capacity-types) and Launch template support (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide. instanceTypes.[] Required string launchTemplate Optional object An object representing a node group's launch template specification.

The AWS KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK). To use a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. When a CMK isn't specified in KmsKeyId: * If ReplicationSourceIdentifier identifies an encrypted source, then Amazon RDS will use the CMK used to encrypt the source. Otherwise, Amazon RDS will use your default CMK. * If the StorageEncrypted parameter is enabled and ReplicationSourceIdentifier isn't specified, then Amazon RDS will use your default CMK. There is a default CMK for your AWS account. Your AWS account has a different default CMK for each AWS Region. If you create a read replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another AWS Region, you must set KmsKeyId to a AWS KMS key identifier that is valid in the destination AWS Region. This CMK is used to encrypt the read replica in that AWS Region. masterUserPassword Optional object The password for the master database user. This password can contain any printable ASCII character except \"/\", \"\"\", or \"@\". Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 41 characters. masterUserPassword.key Required string Key is the key within the secret masterUserPassword.name Optional string Name is unique within a namespace to reference a secret resource. masterUserPassword.namespace Optional string Namespace defines the space within which the secret name must be unique. masterUsername Optional string The name of the master user for the DB cluster.

Default: 3306 if engine is set as aurora or 5432 if set to aurora-postgresql. preSignedURL Optional string A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CreateDBCluster action to be called in the source AWS Region where the DB cluster is replicated from. You only need to specify PreSignedUrl when you are performing cross-region replication from an encrypted DB cluster. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBCluster API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values: * KmsKeyId - The AWS KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination AWS Region. This should refer to the same AWS KMS CMK for both the CreateDBCluster action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL. * DestinationRegion - The name of the AWS Region that Aurora read replica will be created in. * ReplicationSourceIdentifier - The DB cluster identifier for the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your ReplicationSourceIdentifier would look like Example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1.

If you use S3Prefix for S3DataType, the results of the S3 key prefix matches are shuffled. If you use ManifestFile, the order of the S3 object references in the ManifestFile is shuffled. If you use AugmentedManifestFile, the order of the JSON lines in the AugmentedManifestFile is shuffled. The shuffling order is determined using the Seed value. For Pipe input mode, when ShuffleConfig is specified shuffling is done at the start of every epoch. With large datasets, this ensures that the order of the training data is different for each epoch, and it helps reduce bias and possible overfitting. In a multi-node training job when ShuffleConfig is combined with S3DataDistributionType of ShardedByS3Key, the data is shuffled across nodes so that the content sent to a particular node on the first epoch might be sent to a different node on the second epoch. trainingJobDefinition.inputDataConfig.[].shuffleConfig.seed Optional integer trainingJobDefinition.outputDataConfig Optional object Provides information about how to store model training results (model artifacts). trainingJobDefinition.outputDataConfig.kmsKeyID Optional string trainingJobDefinition.outputDataConfig.s3OutputPath Optional string trainingJobDefinition.resourceConfig Optional object Describes the resources, including ML compute instances and ML storage volumes, to use for model training. trainingJobDefinition.resourceConfig.instanceCount Optional integer trainingJobDefinition.resourceConfig.instanceType Optional string trainingJobDefinition.resourceConfig.volumeKMSKeyID Optional string trainingJobDefinition.resourceConfig.volumeSizeInGB Optional integer trainingJobDefinition.roleARN Optional string trainingJobDefinition.staticHyperParameters Optional object trainingJobDefinition.stoppingCondition Optional object Specifies a limit to how long a model training or compilation job can run. It also specifies how long you are willing to wait for a managed spot training job to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the training or compilation job. Use this API to cap model training costs. To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. The training algorithms provided by Amazon SageMaker automatically save the intermediate results of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from which it can be saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a model with CreateModel. The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient for the training job to complete. trainingJobDefinition.stoppingCondition.maxRuntimeInSeconds Optional integer trainingJobDefinition.stoppingCondition.maxWaitTimeInSeconds Optional integer trainingJobDefinition.tuningObjective Optional object Defines the objective metric for a hyperparameter tuning job.

If you use S3Prefix for S3DataType, the results of the S3 key prefix matches are shuffled. If you use ManifestFile, the order of the S3 object references in the ManifestFile is shuffled. If you use AugmentedManifestFile, the order of the JSON lines in the AugmentedManifestFile is shuffled. The shuffling order is determined using the Seed value. For Pipe input mode, when ShuffleConfig is specified shuffling is done at the start of every epoch. With large datasets, this ensures that the order of the training data is different for each epoch, and it helps reduce bias and possible overfitting. In a multi-node training job when ShuffleConfig is combined with S3DataDistributionType of ShardedByS3Key, the data is shuffled across nodes so that the content sent to a particular node on the first epoch might be sent to a different node on the second epoch. trainingJobDefinition.inputDataConfig.[].shuffleConfig.seed Optional integer trainingJobDefinition.outputDataConfig Optional object Provides information about how to store model training results (model artifacts). trainingJobDefinition.outputDataConfig.kmsKeyID Optional string trainingJobDefinition.outputDataConfig.s3OutputPath Optional string trainingJobDefinition.resourceConfig Optional object Describes the resources, including ML compute instances and ML storage volumes, to use for model training. trainingJobDefinition.resourceConfig.instanceCount Optional integer trainingJobDefinition.resourceConfig.instanceType Optional string trainingJobDefinition.resourceConfig.volumeKMSKeyID Optional string trainingJobDefinition.resourceConfig.volumeSizeInGB Optional integer trainingJobDefinition.roleARN Optional string trainingJobDefinition.staticHyperParameters Optional object trainingJobDefinition.stoppingCondition Optional object Specifies a limit to how long a model training or compilation job can run. It also specifies how long you are willing to wait for a managed spot training job to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the training or compilation job. Use this API to cap model training costs. To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. The training algorithms provided by Amazon SageMaker automatically save the intermediate results of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from which it can be saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a model with CreateModel. The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient for the training job to complete. trainingJobDefinition.stoppingCondition.maxRuntimeInSeconds Optional integer trainingJobDefinition.stoppingCondition.maxWaitTimeInSeconds Optional integer trainingJobDefinition.tuningObjective Optional object Defines the objective metric for a hyperparameter tuning job.

To learn more about how to configure the DebugHookConfig parameter, see Use the SageMaker and Debugger Configuration API Operations to Create, Update, and Debug Your Training Job (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/debugger-createtrainingjob-api.html). debugHookConfig.collectionConfigurations Optional array debugHookConfig.collectionConfigurations.[] Required object Configuration information for the Debugger output tensor collections. debugHookConfig.collectionConfigurations.[].collectionParameters Optional object debugHookConfig.hookParameters Optional object debugHookConfig.localPath Optional string debugHookConfig.s3OutputPath Optional string debugRuleConfigurations Optional array Configuration information for Debugger rules for debugging output tensors. debugRuleConfigurations.[] Required object Configuration information for SageMaker Debugger rules for debugging. To learn more about how to configure the DebugRuleConfiguration parameter, see Use the SageMaker and Debugger Configuration API Operations to Create, Update, and Debug Your Training Job (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/debugger-createtrainingjob-api.html). debugRuleConfigurations.[].localPath Optional string debugRuleConfigurations.[].ruleConfigurationName Optional string debugRuleConfigurations.[].ruleEvaluatorImage Optional string debugRuleConfigurations.[].ruleParameters Optional object debugRuleConfigurations.[].s3OutputPath Optional string debugRuleConfigurations.[].volumeSizeInGB Optional integer enableInterContainerTrafficEncryption Optional boolean To encrypt all communications between ML compute instances in distributed training, choose True. Encryption provides greater security for distributed training, but training might take longer. How long it takes depends on the amount of communication between compute instances, especially if you use a deep learning algorithm in distributed training. For more information, see Protect Communications Between ML Compute Instances in a Distributed Training Job (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/train-encrypt.html). enableManagedSpotTraining Optional boolean To train models using managed spot training, choose True. Managed spot training provides a fully managed and scalable infrastructure for training machine learning models. this option is useful when training jobs can be interrupted and when there is flexibility when the training job is run. The complete and intermediate results of jobs are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, and can be used as a starting point to train models incrementally. Amazon SageMaker provides metrics and logs in CloudWatch. They can be used to see when managed spot training jobs are running, interrupted, resumed, or completed. enableNetworkIsolation Optional boolean Isolates the training container. No inbound or outbound network calls can be made, except for calls between peers within a training cluster for distributed training. If you enable network isolation for training jobs that are configured to use a VPC, Amazon SageMaker downloads and uploads customer data and model artifacts through the specified VPC, but the training container does not have network access. environment Optional object The environment variables to set in the Docker container. experimentConfig Optional object Associates a SageMaker job as a trial component with an experiment and trial. Specified when you call the following APIs: * CreateProcessingJob * CreateTrainingJob * CreateTransformJob experimentConfig.experimentName Optional string experimentConfig.trialComponentDisplayName Optional string experimentConfig.trialName Optional string hyperParameters Optional object Algorithm-specific parameters that influence the quality of the model. You set hyperparameters before you start the learning process. For a list of hyperparameters for each training algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker, see Algorithms (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html). You can specify a maximum of 100 hyperparameters. Each hyperparameter is a key-value pair. Each key and value is limited to 256 characters, as specified by the Length Constraint. inputDataConfig Optional array An array of Channel objects. Each channel is a named input source. InputDataConfig describes the input data and its location. Algorithms can accept input data from one or more channels. For example, an algorithm might have two channels of input data, training_data and validation_data. The configuration for each channel provides the S3, EFS, or FSx location where the input data is stored. It also provides information about the stored data: the MIME type, compression method, and whether the data is wrapped in RecordIO format. Depending on the input mode that the algorithm supports, Amazon SageMaker either copies input data files from an S3 bucket to a local directory in the Docker container, or makes it available as input streams. For example, if you specify an EFS location, input data files will be made available as input streams. They do not need to be downloaded. inputDataConfig.[] Required object A channel is a named input source that training algorithms can consume. inputDataConfig.[].compressionType Optional string inputDataConfig.[].contentType Optional string inputDataConfig.[].dataSource Optional object Describes the location of the channel data. inputDataConfig.[].dataSource.fileSystemDataSource Optional object Specifies a file system data source for a channel. inputDataConfig.[].dataSource.fileSystemDataSource.directoryPath Optional string inputDataConfig.[].dataSource.fileSystemDataSource.fileSystemAccessMode Optional string inputDataConfig.[].dataSource.fileSystemDataSource.fileSystemID Optional string inputDataConfig.[].dataSource.fileSystemDataSource.fileSystemType Optional string inputDataConfig.[].dataSource.s3DataSource Optional object Describes the S3 data source. inputDataConfig.[].dataSource.s3DataSource.attributeNames Optional array inputDataConfig.[].dataSource.s3DataSource.attributeNames.[] Required string inputDataConfig.[].dataSource.s3DataSource.s3DataType Optional string inputDataConfig.[].dataSource.s3DataSource.s3URI Optional string inputDataConfig.[].inputMode Optional string inputDataConfig.[].recordWrapperType Optional string inputDataConfig.[].shuffleConfig Optional object A configuration for a shuffle option for input data in a channel. If you use S3Prefix for S3DataType, the results of the S3 key prefix matches are shuffled. If you use ManifestFile, the order of the S3 object references in the ManifestFile is shuffled. If you use AugmentedManifestFile, the order of the JSON lines in the AugmentedManifestFile is shuffled. The shuffling order is determined using the Seed value. For Pipe input mode, when ShuffleConfig is specified shuffling is done at the start of every epoch. With large datasets, this ensures that the order of the training data is different for each epoch, and it helps reduce bias and possible overfitting. In a multi-node training job when ShuffleConfig is combined with S3DataDistributionType of ShardedByS3Key, the data is shuffled across nodes so that the content sent to a particular node on the first epoch might be sent to a different node on the second epoch. inputDataConfig.[].shuffleConfig.seed Optional integer outputDataConfig Required object Specifies the path to the S3 location where you want to store model artifacts. Amazon SageMaker creates subfolders for the artifacts. outputDataConfig.kmsKeyID Optional string outputDataConfig.s3OutputPath Optional string profilerConfig Optional object Configuration information for Debugger system monitoring, framework profiling, and storage paths. profilerConfig.profilingIntervalInMilliseconds Optional integer profilerConfig.profilingParameters Optional object profilerConfig.s3OutputPath Optional string profilerRuleConfigurations Optional array Configuration information for Debugger rules for profiling system and framework metrics. profilerRuleConfigurations.[] Required object Configuration information for profiling rules. profilerRuleConfigurations.[].localPath Optional string profilerRuleConfigurations.[].ruleConfigurationName Optional string profilerRuleConfigurations.[].ruleEvaluatorImage Optional string profilerRuleConfigurations.[].ruleParameters Optional object profilerRuleConfigurations.[].s3OutputPath Optional string profilerRuleConfigurations.[].volumeSizeInGB Optional integer resourceConfig Required object The resources, including the ML compute instances and ML storage volumes, to use for model training. ML storage volumes store model artifacts and incremental states. Training algorithms might also use ML storage volumes for scratch space. If you want Amazon SageMaker to use the ML storage volume to store the training data, choose File as the TrainingInputMode in the algorithm specification. For distributed training algorithms, specify an instance count greater than 1. resourceConfig.instanceCount Optional integer resourceConfig.instanceType Optional string resourceConfig.volumeKMSKeyID Optional string resourceConfig.volumeSizeInGB Optional integer roleARN Required string The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to perform tasks on your behalf. During model training, Amazon SageMaker needs your permission to read input data from an S3 bucket, download a Docker image that contains training code, write model artifacts to an S3 bucket, write logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and publish metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. You grant permissions for all of these tasks to an IAM role. For more information, see Amazon SageMaker Roles (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html). To be able to pass this role to Amazon SageMaker, the caller of this API must have the iam:PassRole permission. stoppingCondition Required object Specifies a limit to how long a model training job can run. When the job reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the training job. Use this API to cap model training costs. To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. stoppingCondition.maxRuntimeInSeconds Optional integer stoppingCondition.maxWaitTimeInSeconds Optional integer tags Optional array An array of key-value pairs.

If MaxConcurrentTransforms is set to 0 or left unset, Amazon SageMaker checks the optional execution-parameters to determine the settings for your chosen algorithm. If the execution-parameters endpoint is not enabled, the default value is 1. For more information on execution-parameters, see How Containers Serve Requests (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-batch-code.html#your-algorithms-batch-code-how-containe-serves-requests). For built-in algorithms, you don't need to set a value for MaxConcurrentTransforms. maxPayloadInMB Optional integer The maximum allowed size of the payload, in MB. A payload is the data portion of a record (without metadata). The value in MaxPayloadInMB must be greater than, or equal to, the size of a single record. To estimate the size of a record in MB, divide the size of your dataset by the number of records. To ensure that the records fit within the maximum payload size, we recommend using a slightly larger value. The default value is 6 MB. For cases where the payload might be arbitrarily large and is transmitted using HTTP chunked encoding, set the value to 0. This feature works only in supported algorithms. Currently, Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms do not support HTTP chunked encoding. modelClientConfig Optional object Configures the timeout and maximum number of retries for processing a transform job invocation. modelClientConfig.invocationsMaxRetries Optional integer modelClientConfig.invocationsTimeoutInSeconds Optional integer modelName Required string The name of the model that you want to use for the transform job.

Kubernetes RBAC governs a Kubernetes user's ability to read or write Kubernetes resources, while AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies govern the ability of an AWS IAM role to read or write AWS resources. These two RBAC systems do not overlap The Kubernetes user that makes a Kubernetes API call with kubectl has no association with an IAM role. Instead, the IAM role is associated with the service account that runs the ACK service controller's pod. Refer to the following diagram for more details on running a Kubernetes API server with RBAC authorization mode enabled. You will need to configure Kubernetes RBAC and AWS IAM permissions before using ACK service controllers. Step 1: Configure Kubernetes RBAC \u00b6 As part of installation, Kubernetes Role resources are automatically created. These roles contain permissions to modify the Kubernetes custom resources (CRs) that the ACK service controller is responsible for. ACK resources are namespace-scoped All Kubernetes CRs managed by an ACK service controller are namespace-scoped resources. There are no cluster-scoped ACK-managed CRs. By default, the following Kubernetes Role resources are created when installing an ACK service controller: ack-$SERVICE-writer : a Role used for reading and mutating namespace-scoped CRs that the ACK service controller manages. ack-$SERVICE-reader : a Role used for reading namespaced-scoped CRs that the ACK service controller manages. For example, installing the ACK service controller for AWS S3 creates the ack-s3-writer and ack-s3-reader roles, both with a GroupKind of s3.services.k8s.aws/Bucket within a specific Kubernetes Namespace .

The IAM role needs the correct IAM policies for a given ACK service controller. For example, the ACK service controller for AWS S3 needs read and write permission for S3 Buckets. It is recommended that the IAM policy gives only enough access to properly manage the resources needed for a specific AWS service. To use the recommended IAM policy for a given ACK service controller, refer to the recommended-policy-arn file in the config/iam/ folder within that service's public repository. This document contains the AWS Resource Name (ARN) of the recommended managed policy for a specific service. For example, the recommended IAM policy ARN for AWS S3 is: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess .

Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials to the containers or using the Amazon EC2 instance\u2019s role, you can associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account. The applications in a Kubernetes pod container can then use an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI to make API requests to authorized AWS services. By using the IRSA feature, you no longer need to provide extended permissions to the node IAM role so that pods on that node can call AWS APIs. You can scope IAM permissions to a service account, and only pods that use that service account have access to those permissions. EKS is not required to use IRSA You do not need to use the Amazon EKS service in order to use IRSA. You can set up IRSA on your own Kubernetes installation . The following steps demonstrate how to set up IRSA on an EKS cluster while installing the ACK S3 controller using Helm charts. By modifying the variable values as needed, these steps can be applied for the installation of other ACK service controllers. Step 1. Create an OIDC identity provider for your cluster \u00b6 Create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider for your EKS cluster using the eksctl utils command: export EKS_CLUSTER_NAME =< eks cluster name > export AWS_REGION =< aws region id > eksctl utils associate - iam - oidc - provider -- cluster $ EKS_CLUSTER_NAME -- region $ AWS_REGION -- approve For detailed instructions, refer to Amazon EKS documentation on how to create an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster .

You will need this ARN for later steps. Attach an IAM policy to the IAM role \u00b6 # This example uses a pre-existing policy for Amazon S3 # Create an IAM policy and use its ARN and update IAM_POLICY_ARN variable as needed IAM_POLICY_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess' aws iam attach - role - policy \\ -- role - name \"${ACK_CONTROLLER_IAM_ROLE}\" \\ -- policy - arn \"$IAM_POLICY_ARN\" For detailed instructions, refer to Amazon EKS documentation on creating an IAM role and policy for your service account . Step 3. Associate an IAM role to a service account \u00b6 If you installed your ACK service controller using a Helm chart , then a service account already exists on your cluster. However, it is still neccessary to associate an IAM role with the service account. Verify that your service account exists using kubectl describe : kubectl describe serviceaccount/$ACK_K8S_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME -n $ACK_K8S_NAMESPACE Note that the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that you created is not yet set as an annotation for the service account. Use the following commands to associate an IAM role to a service account: # Annotate the service account with the ARN export ISRA_ROLE_ARN = eks . amazonaws . com / role - arn =< IAM Role Arn > kubectl annotate serviceaccount - n $ ACK_K8S_NAMESPACE $ ACK_K8S_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME $ ISRA_ROLE_ARN If you have not done so already, update the AWS region of your ACK service controller using the following commands: # Update your controller with the correct AWS region. Example: us-east-1 export AWS_SERVICE_NAME = \"s3\" export ACK_K8S_RELEASE_NAME = ack -$ AWS_SERVICE_NAME - controller kubectl - n $ ACK_K8S_NAMESPACE set env deployment /$ ACK_K8S_RELEASE_NAME \\ AWS_REGION = \"$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID\" Edit Helm charts directly on your local file system \u00b6 If you did not already install your ACK service controller using Helm charts, you can directly edit the Helm chart YAML files on your local file system. Update the values.yaml file and set the value for aws.region and serviceAccount.annotations . # Update variables as needed for your ACK service controller ACK_CONTROLLER_HELM_CHARTS_DIR =< directory containing Helm chart for ACK service controller > AWS_SERVICE_NAME = \"s3\" ACK_K8S_NAMESPACE = ack - system ACK_K8S_RELEASE_NAME = ack -$ AWS_SERVICE_NAME - controller cd \"$ACK_CONTROLLER_HELM_CHARTS_DIR\" # Dry run and verify the output helm install -- debug -- dry - run -- namespace \"$ACK_K8S_NAMESPACE\" \"$ACK_K8S_RELEASE_NAME\" . # Install the ACK service controller on your cluster helm install -- create - namespace -- namespace \"$ACK_K8S_NAMESPACE\" \"$ACK_K8S_RELEASE_NAME\" . Verify that the service account has been created on your cluster and that its annotations include the IAM role for your ACK service controller. kubectl describe serviceaccount/$ACK_K8S_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME -n $ACK_K8S_NAMESPACE For detailed instructions, refer to Amazon EKS documentation on how to associate an IAM role to a service account . Step 4: Verify successful setup \u00b6 When AWS clients or SDKs connect to an AWS API, they detect an AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity security token to assume the IAM role. Verify that the AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE and AWS_ROLE_ARN environment variables exist for your Kubernetes pod using the following commands: kubectl get pods - A kubectl exec - n $AC K_K8S_NAMESPACE < NAME > env | grep ack The output should look similar to the following: AWS_ROLE_ARN = arn : aws : iam :: < AWS_ACCOUNT_ID > : role /< IAM_ROLE_NAME > AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE =/ var / run / secrets / eks . amazonaws . com / serviceaccount / token","title":"IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)"},{"location":"user-docs/irsa/#iam-roles-for-service-accounts-irsa","text":"IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) automates the provisioning and rotation of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) temporary credentials that a Kubernetes service account can use to call AWS APIs.
