# Getting started With ACK service controllers

**AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)** lets you define and use AWS service resources directly from Kubernetes. With ACK, you can take advantage of AWS-managed services for your Kubernetes applications without needing to define resources outside of the cluster or run services that provide supporting capabilities like databases or message queues within the cluster.

* [Configure permissions for authorization and access][authorization]
* [IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)][irsa]
* [Cross-Account Resource Management (CARM)][carm]
* [Cleanup][cleanup]

## Docker images

Each ACK service controller is packaged into a separate container image that is published in a public repository corresponding to an individual ACK service controller.

!!! note "Choose the ACK Docker image that is right for you"
    Note that there is no single ACK Docker image. Instead, there are Docker
    images for each individual ACK service controller that manages resources
    for a particular AWS API.

Docker images for ACK service controllers can be found in the [ACK registry within the Amazon ECR Public Gallery][ack-ecr-gallery]. To find a Docker image for a specific service, you can go to `gallery.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/$SERVICENAME-controller`. For example, the link to the ACK service controller Docker image for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is [`gallery.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-controller`][s3-ecr-controller].

Individual ACK service controllers are tagged with their release version. You can find image URIs for different releases under the `Image tags` section in the image repository on the ECR Public Gallery.

!!! note "Be sure to specify release version"
    You must always specify a version tag when referencing an ACK service controller image.

In accordance with [best practices][no-latest-tag], we do not include `:latest` default tags for our image repositories.

## Next steps

This guide assumes that you have access to a Kubernetes cluster. You do not need to use the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) to get started with ACK service controllers. If you do not yet have a Kubernetes cluster and would like to use Amazon EKS, you can visit the [Amazon EKS Setup][eks-setup] guide. 

Once you have access to a Kubernetes cluster, you can [install the ACK service controller of your choice][install].
