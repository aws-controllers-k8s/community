# Services

The following AWS service APIs have service controllers included in ACK or have
controllers currently being built.

For details, including a list of planned AWS service APIs, see the [Service
Controller Release Roadmap](https://github.com/aws/aws-controllers-k8s/projects/1):

!!! note "IMPORTANT"
    There is no single release of the ACK project. The ACK project contains a
    series of service controllers, one for each AWS service API. Each
    individual ACK service controller is released separately. Please see the
    documentation on [release criteria](releases.md) for information on how we
    release ACK service controllers.
