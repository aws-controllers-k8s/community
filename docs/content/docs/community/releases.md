Service controllers are built in separate source code repositories. Below, you
will find a description of the [Project Stages](#project-stages) that a service
controller repository goes through on its way to being released.

A controller that has reached the `RELEASED` project stage will have a set of
release artifacts, including binary container images for the controller and a Helm
Chart that installs the controller into a target Kubernetes cluster. Read more
below about our [Releases and Versioning policy](#releases-and-versioning). 

Finally, we have a set of documented [Maintenance Phases](#maintenance-phases)
that clearly outline our support stance for service controllers that have been
released.

## Project Stages

The controller's "project stage" describes how far along the controller is
towards being released:

[`PROPOSED`](#proposed) -> [`PLANNED`](#planned) -> [`IN PROGRESS`](#in-progress) -> [`RELEASED`](#released)

### PROPOSED

The `PROPOSED` stage indicates that there is expressed interest in supporting
an AWS service in ACK.

At this stage, there will be a Github Issue and/or a Github Project for
tracking the creation of the ACK service controller for the service.

The GitHub Issue **WILL NOT** be associated with a GitHub Milestone.

### PLANNED

The `PLANNED` stage indicates that we plan to make a controller for this
service available in ACK.

At this stage, there **WILL BE** a GitHub Milestone that tracks progress
towards the release of the controller.

### IN PROGRESS

The `IN PROGRESS` stage indicates that the ACK service controller for the AWS
service is **actively being built** in preparation for a release of that ACK
service controller.

In the `IN PROGRESS` stage we identify those **AWS service API resources** that
will be supported by the controller and generate the code that manages the
lifecycle of these resources.

{{% hint title="What do we mean by 'AWS service API resources'?" type="info" %}}
An *AWS service API resource* is a top-level object that can be created by
a particular AWS service API. For example, an SNS Topic or an S3 Bucket.
Some service APIs have multiple top-level resources; SNS, for instance, has
Topic, PlatformApplication and PlatformEndpoint top-level resources that
may be created.
{{% /hint %}}

### RELEASED

The `RELEASED` project stage indicates that the ACK service controller source
repository has had a Semantic Versioning Git tag applied and that both a container
image and Helm Chart have been built and published to the ECR Public
repositories for ACK.

Once a service controller reaches the `RELEASED` project stage, that **does not
mean** that there can never be any changes or additions to the Custom Resource
Definitions (CRDs) or public interfaces exposed by that service controller. The
`RELEASED` project stage is simply an indication that there is at least one
SemVer-tagged binary release of the controller.

Consumers should look to the SemVer release tag as an indication of whether
code included in that release introduces new breaking (major version increment)
or non-breaking features (minor version increment) or simply bug fixes (patch
version increment).  Consumers should see release notes for a release tag for a
full description of changes included in that release.

## Releases and Versioning

{{% hint type="danger" title="Important" %}}
ACK does *not* have a single release status or version.
Different components within the ACK project have different release cadences,
versions and statuses. Please read the information below before installing
any ACK component.
{{% /hint %}}

Service controllers in ACK use [Semantic Versioning](#semantic-versioning) to
indicate whether changes included in a particular binary release introduce
features or bug fixes and whether or not features break backwards compatibility
for public APIs and interfaces.

There are two release artifacts produced when an ACK service controller is
released: a binary **container image** with the controller and a **Helm Chart**
that installs the controller into a target Kubernetes cluster. Both these
artifacts will have tags that correspond to the Semantic Version Git tag
applied against the source code repository for the controller.

### Semantic Versioning

ACK is a collection of custom Kubernetes controllers, one for each supported
AWS API. Each ACK controller is composed of an [ACK common runtime][ackrt] and
Go code that links the Kubernetes API and the AWS API. Much of this Go code is
generated by the [`ack-generate`][codegen] tool; some of the Go code is
hand-crafted.

[ackrt]: https://github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/runtime
[codegen]: https://github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/code-generator

**All code components** in ACK use [Semantic Versioning][semver] (SemVer) as a
signal to consumers whether public interfaces or APIs have breaking changes.

[semver]: https://semver.org/

When an ACK component is ***released***, a Git tag containing a SemVer (X.Y.Z)
is created on the component's source repository. If the commits to the source
repository in between the last Git tag and the commit being tagged have
introduced changes that break public-facing APIs or interfaces, the SemVer will
have its major version ("X") incremented. If the commits introduce
functionality that does not break interfaces or APIs, the minor version ("Y")
will be incremented. If the commits simply fix bugs and do not introduce any
features or interface changes, the patch version ("Z") will be incremented.

Releases of any ACK component that have a zero major release number (e.g.
`0.0.2`) may have breaking changes to the public API or interfaces exposed by
that component.

This is by design, and [per the Semantic Versioning specification][semver-zero]:

> Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at
> any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.

[semver-zero]: https://semver.org/#spec-item-4

For ACK components that have a binary distributable -- i.e. a container image --
the creation of a new SemVer Git tag on the source code repository triggers the
automatic building and publishing of a container image with an image tag including
the SemVer version.

For example, if a Git tag of `v1.2.6` was created on the
[github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-controller][s3-ctrl] repository, a container
image with a tag `1.2.6` would be published to the
[public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-controller][ecr-ack-ctrl] ECR Public
repository.

{{% hint %}}
Binaries for individual ACK service controllers components are published in
separate Amazon ECR Public repositories.

For ACK components that have a Helm Chart distributable -- i.e. an ACK service
controller -- the creation of a new SemVer Git tag on the source code
repository triggers automatic building and publishing of a Helm Chart with
an artifact tag including the SemVer version.

For example, a Git tag of `v1.2.6` on the
[github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-controller][s3-ctrl]
repository means a Helm chart with a tag `1.2.6` would be published to the
[public.ecr.aws/aws-controllers-k8s/s3-chart][ecr-ack-chart] ECR Public
repository.

#### A Word About Dependencies

Each service-specific ACK controller -- e.g. the ElastiCache ACK controller --
depends on a specific version of the ACK common runtime. This dependency is
specified in the controller's `go.mod` file.

The ACK code generator that produces Go code for service controllers depends on
a specific version of the ACK common runtime.

{{% hint title="Dependency between the code generator and common runtime" type="info" %}}
The ACK code generator depends on the ACK common runtime in a unique way:
the Go code that the ACK code generator *produces* adheres to a specific
version of the ACK common runtime. Even though no Go code in the ACK code
generator actually imports the ACK common runtime, this dependency exists
because the Go code produced by the templates inside the code generator imports
the ACK common runtime. In order to make this Go code dependency more strict,
we have a test package inside the ACK code generator that imports the ACK
common runtime. In this way, we're able to include a version-specific
dependency line in the ACK code generator's `go.mod` file, thereby allowing
Go's module infrastructure to pin the dependency between the code generator and
the common runtime.

## Maintenance Phases

As noted above, individual ACK service controllers all use Semantic Versioning
("X.Y.Z") in order to signal breaking interface changes. However, each
controller follows its own release cadence and each controller has a separate
team of contributors that maintain the code, test the controller and determine
whether the controller is stable in long-running operation.

ACK service controllers having release tags within a major Semantic Version
("X") will be in one of four Maintenance Phases:

* [PREVIEW](#preview)
* [GENERAL AVAILABILITY](#general-availability) (GA)
* [DEPRECATED](#deprecated)
* [NOT SUPPORTED](#not-supported)

### Preview

ACK controllers in the `Preview` Maintenance Phase are released for testing by
users and are not recommended for production use.

For `Preview` controllers, we ask users to submit bug reports using Github
Issues and we will do our best to remediate problems in a timely manner.

### General Availability

ACK controllers in the `General Availability` (GA) Maintenance Phase have been
through long-running "soak" tests and are recommended for production use by the
team maintaining that controller.

All ACK controllers in the `General Availability` Maintenance Phase will have a
Helm Chart tagged with the major version >0 (eg. `1.0.0`).

Users who submit bug reports using Github Issues that reference a `General
Availability` controller will have their bug reports prioritized by the
contributor team maintaining that controller.

### Deprecated

ACK controllers in the `General Availability` Maintenance Phase may move to a
`Deprecated` Maintenance Phase after a Deprecation Warning notice has been sent
out (and the controller's documentation has been updated with said deprecation
notice).

Controllers in `Deprecated` Maintenance Phase continue to receive the same
level of support as controllers in the `General Availability` phase.

### Not Supported

ACK controllers may eventually be moved into a `Not Supported` Maintenance Phase.

A controller major version series may move from the `Preview` Maintenance Phase
to the `Not Supported` Maintenance Phase at any time. This may happen if the
team maintaining the controller determines it is not possible to get the
controller with that major version series into a `General Availability` phase.

A controller major version series may move from the `Deprecated`
Maintenance Phase to the `Not Supported` Maintenance Phase *only after a 1-year
deprecation period has elapsed*.
