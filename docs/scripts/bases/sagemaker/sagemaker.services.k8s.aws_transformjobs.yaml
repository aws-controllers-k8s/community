                  is the data portion of a record (without metadata). The value in
                  MaxPayloadInMB must be greater than, or equal to, the size of a
                  single record. To estimate the size of a record in MB, divide the
                  size of your dataset by the number of records. To ensure that the
                  records fit within the maximum payload size, we recommend using
                  a slightly larger value. The default value is 6 MB. \n For cases
                  where the payload might be arbitrarily large and is transmitted
                  using HTTP chunked encoding, set the value to 0. This feature works
                  only in supported algorithms. Currently, Amazon SageMaker built-in
                  algorithms do not support HTTP chunked encoding."
