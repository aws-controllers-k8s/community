# Writing and publishing docs

Our docs are written in [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

MkDocs is a static site generator. It converts markdown files to static html pages. Edit the markdown files, and view the rendered site with MkDocs.

## Build the docs locally

### Install mkdocs-material

ðŸŸ§ The ACK docs require the mkdocs-material theme.

To ensure you are using a compatible version of mkdocs and the mkdocs-material theme, use a python virtual environment. Then, install mkdocs-material.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin mkdocs-macros-plugin
```

Visit the python docs to learn more about [virutal environments (venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Optionally, use a global `.gitignore` to hide the `venv` directory.

### Local preview

ðŸŸ§ Test locally, including both the content and the navigation structure.

The docs are just Markdown files and in order to see the rendered preview locally (before PRing the repo), do:

```
 $ mkdocs serve -f docs/mkdocs.yaml

### Writing

The [MkDocs reference](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) includes information on the structure of the `docs/` folder, and writing in markdown.

Review the [Material for MkDocs reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/formatting/) for information on the theme and formatting.

### Generating the reference

Our documentation contains an API reference section that is autogenerated from the custom resource definitions of each ACK service. These reference documents need to be re-generated each time there is a change to any of the fields or versions of any of these CRDs.

The `scripts/gen_reference.py` file will attempt to navigate every service controller repository in the `$GOPATH` and build a full model of every custom resource and version based off the CRD base files. It will then output these models into YAML headers placed into markdown files under `contents/reference/<service>/<version>/<resource>.md`, which are then rendered by `mkdocs-macros` snippets in `contents/snippets/`.

To run `scripts/gen_reference.py` navigate to `community/docs` and then run `python3 ./scripts/gen_reference.py`.

### Publish

To publish updated docs, commit changes to the markdown files and open a pull request. When the commit is merged, thepdated documentation is published by a Prow job that runs whenever a new tag of any controller is published, or if any part of the documentation is updated.
